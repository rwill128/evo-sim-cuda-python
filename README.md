# evo-sim-cuda-python

This a GPU-based evolution simulation, inspired by Biogenesis on Sourceforge.

I am organizing the proof of concept code into Jupyter notebooks, and adding unit and performance tests as I refine the evolution dynamics I am seeking to create.

Please inquire if you would like to contribute in any way.
