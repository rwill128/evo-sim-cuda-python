# evo-sim-cuda-python

This a GPU-based evolution simulation, inspired by Biogenesis on Sourceforge.

I am organizing the proof of concept code into Jupyter notebooks, and adding unit and performance tests as I refine the evolution dynamics I am seeking to create.

Please inquire if you would like to contribute in any way.

:oxygen expulsion from plants
:incorporating smoothed land maps and using height-based photosynthesis effectiveness
:oxygen drift that is aware of carbon dioxide density
:only allowing plants to grow when touching water
:reproduction via seeds or some other method, with tweaked growth tendencies and parameters based on that
:segment maintenance cost implemented for plants
:lifespan potentially?
:at death, disappear or decompose?
